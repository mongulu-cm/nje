        <h6 class="mr-5 mt-3"><b>Preamble</b></h6>
        <p>
           The "mongulu" collective was born from a desire to promote the creation of free tools adapted to the needs of the Cameroonian community in France.
           It intends to rely on people who feel close to this community and want to make available to it their knowledge, digital know-how in a voluntary way.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Objective</b></h6>
    <p>
      The collective takes its name from the hut of the <a href="https://images.cnrs.fr/reportage-photo/rep000679"> Baka people</a>
      who are the most numerous representatives of the group commonly known as "pygmies." These are known to have conserved
      to a certain extent the forest as a privileged living space. The mongulu are the huts that they build when they move
      The mongulu are the huts that they build when they move in order to change their hunting area during the year. The hut thus contains
      a set of tools serving the Baka community. Inspired by this we want to construct mongulu as a space
      where each member of the Cameroonian community can pick up and find a useful tool. </p>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Vision</b></h6>
    <p>
     To become in a long term, an essential actor of the digital in the Cameroonian community in France with a strong
     anchorage on our values..
    </p>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Values</b></h6>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <b>Humility and recognition in the service of the common </b>- the "bakas" are today a people
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbr_IAn7HSg"> marginalized in Cameroon</a> (no national identity card, land/hunting area problem) even though they hold an
        essential place in the history of Cameroon. On the one hand, because they are most certainly the first inhabitants
        of Cameroon and on the other hand the central role they played in the <a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/fr/espace-presse/documents-presse/histoire-migratoire-peuples-bantous-comment-genomique-rend-hommage-au-metissage-eclaire-recit"> establishment on the spot </a> of
        many ethnic groups called "Bantu" ... Using the name of their hut as a collective name is therefore a way to
        way to pay tribute to them as Cameroonians for what they have done for us and to inscribe ourselves in this logic for
        in this logic for the duration.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <b>Empowerment and emancipation of women through technology</b> - in "baka" society the
        <a href="https://www.canal-u.tv/video/smm/chronique_des_pygmees_baka_construction_de_huttes_mongulu.23336">construction of mongulu </a> which
        is however the dwelling place is carried out only by women. This gives them a certain power in
        the social organization, indeed the technique of construction is known only by them, it is not a simple
        It is not a question of a simple separation of the tasks. This is why one of our founding members is a woman.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <b>Free software</b> - we subscribe to the values that support free software and we believe that it
        is one of the keys to emancipation through digital Cameroon. Indeed, we believe that to innovate and
        adopt digital solutions to the Cameroonian context, we need to "appropriate" them (in the etymological sense of the term, that is to say, to
        etymological sense of the word, that is to say, to make them our own), which requires the ability to study, understand and
        modify them without limit. And only free software, it seems to us, satisfies these 3 conditions. This is why all
        the tools developed within the framework of this collective will be free.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Approach</b></h6>
    <p>
      In order to carry out its vision, the collective relies on members who are people who have joined the collective by
      by co-opting a member. The collective is open to all Cameroonians or those close to this community
      of this community with digital skills: development, networks and infrastructures, data,
      Artificial intelligence, ergonomics and interfaces, and finally communication and media etc. Once this step
      members are invited to monthly meetings in which they can either propose new projects or integrate existing ones or
      projects, or integrate existing projects or simply follow their evolution.
      While the proposal of a project is completely free, it can only be integrated into mongulu if it meets a certain number of criteria
      among which:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the project must be in a <b>"dialect"</b> of Cameroon and have a maximum of 2 terms separated by dashes for example mtchoun-mouh.</li>
      <li>The project must benefit in a <b>"practical" way</b> to the Cameroonian community in France.</li>
      <li>The level of complexity of the project must not be high and ideally be able to quickly (over a few months) lead to a Proof of Concept (POC).
        months) lead to a Proof Of Concept (POC).</li>
      <li>The financial cost of setting up the project (infrastructure) must be <b>minimal</b> as far as possible with
      mandatory participation of the project owner.</li>
      <li>The project agrees to have its code passed in <b>GPL license</b> and use preferentially free solutions
        free solutions if integration is needed.</li>
      <li>The project must clarify the <b>skill requirements</b> in the collective allowing it to start or
        develop the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These criteria are decided on a consensus basis during the meeting. The project that does not pass this phase has the
      have the opportunity to retry 3 more times before being definitively rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the project is accepted, it is integrated into the github space of the mongulu project and members who wish to get involved are integrated into it.
      members who want to contribute are integrated into the project, they form a working group. All investments are welcome: it can be
      can be sharing experience on a similar problem, code, designs or even advice. These
      contributions will be highlighted at the monthly meeting where each working group will present its
      the developments made.
    </p>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Interest in joining the group</b></h6>
    <ul class="mr-4">
      <li>Contribute with your peers to improve your community by directly leveraging your skills</li>
      <li>Learn new technologies that you would value in a professional project or simply
        simply out of curiosity by directly participating in a project rather than courses and tutorials</li>
      <li>Discover other ways/methods of working in digital thanks to monthly meetings where is presented
        the context of members' work</li>
      <li>Expand your network whether from a personal or professional point of view (entrepreneurship, reconversion,
        evolution)</li>
    </ul>
    <h6 class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>And in Cameroon?</b></h6>
    <p>
      Our focus is mainly on France, however, we plan to be a known and recognized player in the local
      recognized player in the local digital innovation ecosystem. To do so, we are already in contact with local digital startup incubators such as
      digital startups such as <a href="https://jabaspace.co/"> JABASPACE </a> or <a href="https://www.activspaces.com"> ACTIVSPACES </a>. One of the
      focuses we currently have is conducting amazing workshops with the community of these
      incubators where interested members would present a mongulu or non-mongulu project they have been working on in order to
      to stimulate debate and questions on the spot. This will also be an opportunity for them to give us this type of presentation
      presentation to us in order to get feedback from us as well.
